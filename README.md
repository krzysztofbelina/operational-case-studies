# Operational Case Studies

This repository contains **anonymised, decision-level case studies** from large corporate environments, primarily in **regulated investment fund operations**.

The focus is **not on tools, code, or implementation**, but on:
- governance failures,
- control breakdowns,
- scalability limits,
- and hidden cost drivers behind failed transformations and process changes.

These cases are written from an **operator’s perspective**, based on real production environments.

---

## What This Repository Is
- A collection of **post-mortems and diagnostics** of real operational failures.
- Focused on **decision logic**, not execution mechanics.
- Tool-agnostic, vendor-neutral, and legally anonymised.
- Designed to show **judgment under real constraints**, not textbook best practices.

---

## What This Repository Is Not
- Not a coding or SQL portfolio.
- Not implementation guides or “how-to” documentation.
- Not consulting deliverables or client-specific analyses.
- Not theoretical or academic case studies.

---

## Core Themes
Across the cases, the recurring themes include:
- Automation increasing cost instead of reducing it.
- Parallel processes becoming institutionalised.
- Maker–checker controls weakened by throughput pressure.
- Testing without decision authority.
- Governance incentives diverging from operational reality.
- Scalability ignored until peak volume breaks controls.
- Audit risk emerging from process redesign, not errors.

---

## Intended Audience
- Senior operations leaders (COO, Head of Ops, Head of Fund Services)
- Risk, control, and audit stakeholders
- Transformation and governance decision-makers
- Expert-network conversations (advisory, diagnostics, pre-implementation reviews)

---

## Structure
Each case is:
- Self-contained and readable independently.
- Focused on **what failed, why it failed, and what it cost**.
- Explicit about decision points and their consequences.
- Free of sensitive data, client identifiers, and proprietary tooling details.

Files are numbered for clarity and sequencing, not hierarchy.

---

## Disclaimer
All cases are **fully anonymised** and intentionally abstracted.  
They reflect recurring structural patterns observed across corporate environments, not a single identifiable institution.

The purpose is analytical insight — **not attribution, instruction, or disclosure**.
