# Case Template — Operational / Corporate Failure Analysis

## Executive Failure Summary
Concise, decision-first summary of what failed and why.  
1–2 short paragraphs.  
Focus on **decisions, incentives, and cost**, not tools or people.

---

## Business Context
- Industry / environment (regulated, high-volume, audit-facing, etc.)
- Operational model (e.g. maker–checker)
- Constraints that mattered (volume, timing, controls, governance)

Keep this tight. No background storytelling.

---

## Problem Statement
What the organisation attempted to change and **what objectively went wrong** as a result.

Describe outcomes, not intentions:
- throughput,
- controls,
- cost,
- risk.

---

## Fatal Decision Points
List the **2–4 decisions** that structurally caused failure.

### Fatal Decision #1 — *Short title*
Explain:
- what was decided,
- what alternative was ignored,
- why this decision was structurally wrong.

**Impact**
- concrete operational effects,
- control consequences,
- cost implications (qualitative, order-of-magnitude only).

---

### Fatal Decision #2 — *Short title*
Same structure as above.

---

### Fatal Decision #3 — *Short title*
(Optional — only if it adds value.)

---

## Why Operations Were Right (And Governance Ignored It)
Explain the **misalignment of success metrics**:
- how operations evaluated reality,
- how governance evaluated success,
- why those views diverged,
- who absorbed the cost.

This section should show judgment, not blame.

---

## Financial Impact — Order of Magnitude (Anonymised)
Describe cost **without precise numbers**:
- capacity burn,
- overtime patterns,
- opportunity cost,
- audit and remediation overhead.

Use:
- “order of magnitude”,
- “equivalent to multiple FTE-months per year”,
- “persistent recurring cost”.

Avoid tables with numbers unless absolutely necessary.

---

## Bottom Line
One short paragraph answering:
- *What actually failed?*
- *Why will this failure repeat elsewhere if incentives stay the same?*

This is the takeaway.

---

## Value for Clients
Bullet points only:
- what this case helps prevent,
- what risks it exposes early,
- why this insight saves money or reduces liability.

---

*This case is anonymised, tool-agnostic, and intentionally non-instructional.  
It focuses on decision logic, control integrity, and cost impact — not implementation details.*
